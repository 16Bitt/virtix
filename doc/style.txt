Style and formatting for code in this project
----------------------------------

1. All functions and block statements follow the following rule:
	TYPE|STMT(ARGS){
Note that the opening bracket touches the argument. When avoidable, don't use the brackets at all

2 . All functions are expected to be defined in a header inside of ../header/
The only exceptions are functions that are private but need to be defined lower in the file for clarity

3. Headers will have the following at the top to avoid collisions:
	#define FILE_NAME_H
